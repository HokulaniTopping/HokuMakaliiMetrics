        <p>not generally thrives in slightly acidic to neutral soils (pH 6.0–7.5). The current pH of 5.8 is on the lower end, and aluminum levels are relatively high, which could be problematic in acidic soils. - Utilize biochar from native species like kukui. Kukui biochar can improve pH buffering and soil structure, while also acting as a carbon sink. Apply calcium carbonate (lime) or dolomitic lime to raise the pH slightly. This will also supply additional calcium and magnesium to the soil. However, if dolomite is used, ensure it does not overbalance magnesium, which is already sufficient.<br></br><br></br>

Use local resources like leaf litter from ʻulu, kukui, or other native plants to slowly improve the soil pH while contributing organic matter.<br></br><br></br>

 Nitrogen Management (Nitrate-N and Ammonium-N): Nitrogen levels seem sufficient, but it's essential to maintain nitrogen availability organically, especially for a perennial crop like breadfruit. Use leguminous cover crops such as ‘uala or pigeon pea (Cajanus cajan) to fix nitrogen. These crops can also be part of an agroforestry system that mimics traditional ahupuaʻa-style land management, where multiple crops support each other.<br></br><br></br>

 Apply compost or vermicompost, rich in microbial life, to support continuous nitrogen cycling. This approach nurtures soil health by improving organic matter content and maintaining nitrogen without synthetic fertilizers<br></br><br></br>

Phosphorus levels appear adequate, while potassium is sufficient. Phosphorus availability could still be limited in acidic soils, so strategies to increase its bioavailability are important. Incorporate traditional mulching practices, such as layering organic matter from local plants like kalo or hau, which helps cycle nutrients naturally. For phosphorus, consider adding rock phosphate if necessary, but focus on building soil biology through compost to enhance natural phosphorus mineralization.<br></br><br></br>

Potassium: If needed, apply potassium-rich materials like banana peel mulch or locally sourced wood ash.<br></br>
